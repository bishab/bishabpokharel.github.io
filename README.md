## Portfolio Website


Developed with Jekyll's [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

## How to update
- Only update the `_layouts` section.
- To run the website, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` on tmux.
- For the first time, the changes will not be rendered, so save the changed file (for example, if cv.md is updated, perform ctrl+s on cv.md after running `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This will update the website.)
