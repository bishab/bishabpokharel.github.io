I am a graduate student of the program <b>Intelligent Adaptive Systems (MSc.)</b> at <b>Universität Hamburg, Germany.</b> My research interest is towards LLM training, fine-tuning, deployment, and cross-model evaluation, with knowledge in modern-day LLMs and LLMOps. 

I have 3 years of experience in generative AI for texts (GPT, Llama, Mistral) and vision (GANs, GPT-4o, DALL-E), fulfillment-based chatbots (RASA, Google DialogFlow), Deep Learning and CV (CNNs, YOLO), Software Systems (Python Django, FastAPI, Flask), DevOps (Docker, k8s), and Cloud Services and System Architecture (Terraform for IaaS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, Amazon AWS).

I am working as a <b>Data and Analytics Werkstudent</b> at <a href="https://www.crossnative.com" target="_blank">Crossnative</a> where I develop and deploy client-specific LLM pipelines for business and finance.
Previously I worked as a <b>Werkstudent for ML Development</b> at <a href="https://www.adalab.ai" target="_blank">Adalab</a>, and <b>Machine Learning Engineer Intern</b> at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/robofied" target="_blank">Robofied</a> and <a href="https://technocolabs.com" target="_blank">Technocolabs</a>.
